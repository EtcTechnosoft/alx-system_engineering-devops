In the short course of life, I have found out that to be wise you have to solve problems.
Those who make big success stories did not just come out of the blues, they made a deliberate choice to win.
ALX is so wonderful to the extent that it has made me discover some special abilities in me beyond what I thought I am capable of doing. I now found out that I could have gone farther than this in life if I had given my time to learning new things and working hard on myself.
Grit and growth mindset is one of the events I will never forget in ALX programme. I so pray and wish myself the best in the course of the programme as I anticipate to come out strong.  So help me God!
